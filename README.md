## clustering_spatialMeans

---

Code for to identify different clusters of average crime level with largest posterior probability.

---

## Example
The code currently runs (see forthcoming code snippet).
The repo contains the following:

* scripts: R scripts to generate testing data, plot partitions, and test main functions
* src: C++ source code 



## To-do

* Create functions to find connected components, nearest cluster neighbors, etc.
* Actually perform merges following splits (this involves fixing best_split)
* Improve the search strategy
* Initialize particle set by performing various splits
