## clustering_spatialMeans

---
Code for to identify different clusters of average crime level with largest posterior probability.
---

## Example
The code currently runs (see code snippet below).

## To-do

* Create functions to find connected components, nearest cluster neighbors, etc.
* Actually perform merges following splits (this involves fixing best_split)
* Improve the search strategy
* Initialize particle set by performing various splits
