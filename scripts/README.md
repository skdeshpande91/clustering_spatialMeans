## scripts

This directory contains the following R scripts.

* log_likelihood.R: computes the log-likelihood of a given partition.
* priors.R: computes the log-priors (up to a normalization constant)
* plot_partition.R: plots partitions. Currently only works if the underlying graph is a grid graph.
